# HPE-HGT: Hybrid Positional Encoding for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers


## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**HPE-HGT** is a novel **Hybrid Positional Encoding-based Heterogeneous Graph Transformer** that jointly captures:
- **Semantic proximity** through **meta-path-based positional encodings**  
- **Structural topology** through **Laplacian spectral features**, gated by eigenvalues  

This unique combination allows **HPE-HGT** to condition attention scores on both **type-aware semantics** and **global structural properties**, enabling state-of-the-art performance in heterogeneous graph learning tasks.
